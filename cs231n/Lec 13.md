# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning 
## Supervised Learning
* Data : (x, y) x is data, y is label
* Goal : Learn a *function* to map x -> y
* Examples : Classification, regression, object detection, semantic segmentation, image captioning, etc.

## Unsupervised Learning
* Data : x. just data, no labels
* Goal : Learn some underlying hidden *structure* of the data
* Examples : Clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature learning, density estimation, etc.
