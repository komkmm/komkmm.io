## Machine Learning Definition
> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its
performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.



## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Supervised learning
  > "right answers" given
    - Regression: Predict continuous valued output(Ex. Housing price prediction)
    - Classification: Predict Discrete valued output(Ex. Diagnose disease)
    
- Unsupervised learning
  > "answers" not given
    - Cluster
    
- Reinforcement learning, recommender systems
